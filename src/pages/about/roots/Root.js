            Royal Hills International School Junior was established to provide a
            platform of great opportunities to every child. We endeavor to
            provide exceptional care to our children in a safe and secure
            environment where children feel loved and develop to their fullest
            potential. Here children are not just given wings, but the school
            also ensures that they develop strong roots. Most importantly,
            children are loved and made to feel cherished so that they approach
            life with a positive attitude.

            The curriculum at RHIS Junior is conceived in such a way that
            everything the child learns at the pre school prepares him for an
            easy transition into Grade 1 in any formal schools. This smooth step
            towards a bigger future is accomplished via series of activities
            that are woven into academic programs.
