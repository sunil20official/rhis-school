            Though it may be difficult to avoid the plastic bags at first, it
            needs to be done for the greater good. Plastic is slowly and
            steadily eating away our planet and damaging it. The government has
            banned the use of plastic bags but still, people continue to use it
            despite the ban. we must carry our own cloth or paper bags for
            shopping. Try to pack your food in steel or aluminum containers
            instead of plastic ones. We must encourage children to avoid the use
            of plastic bags. If we see someone using it, we must call them out
            immediately. Never throw away the plastic on roads, as animals die
            after consuming it. We must come together to initiate a ban on
            plastic and make the world safer and healthier.

            <strong>How to Save Water?</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="social-init-p">
            The best way to save water is to use it judiciously. Water pollution
            is another reason that has resulted in loss of fresh water on our
            mother earth. By not throwing industrial wastes in water bodies or
            by not discharging sewage supplies in water bodies, we can save
            water. Water Conservation or Rain water harvesting is the best
            method to save water for various purposes such as irrigation, car
            wash etc.
          </p>
          <p className="social-init-p">
            This initiative can help and promote the conservation of water.
            Also, it can be spread awareness among the people about the
            importance of water.
